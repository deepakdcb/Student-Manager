INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN

TO RUN THE PROGRAM, RUN group_project.py

BE SURE TO ALSO DOWNLOAD creation.py AND edit_view.py TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN FULL

In order to run the program successfully, you will need to either provide 4 csv files as arguments (sample files are provided in the repository),  or provide no argument.

Providing 4 csv files as arguments takes you into EDIT/VIEW mode

Providing no arguments takes you into CREATION mode, where you can create your own student manager database


proper arguments in the command line look as follows:

EDIT/VIEW MODE:
python group_project.py -students "Students.csv" -professors "Professors.csv" -degrees "Degrees.csv" -classes "Classes.csv"

CREATION MODE:
python group_project.py
